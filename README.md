#### HOW TO BUILD
1. Clone or fork this repo
0. Once you have it locally, update the submodules:

```bash 
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. From there, you must build the solution with CMake.

---

#### INSTALLATION
Download from the game's website: https://georgi.itch.io/heroes-journey
A simple GUI installer.

---

#### IMPORTANT
IF any issues are encountered on starting a new game after having an already saved previous one - like for example, not loading you the next encounter after you defeat one such, well simply (and I apologize for that issue) go to the game's folder > save_data folder and delete the game_data file. Issue to be fixed soon... :)

#### CONTROLS
This is a click/point-to action game, where "left mouse button" is mainly used.
"P" is used for pausing the game
"Esc" is used for going back
"Space" is used for skipping (dialogues)
Additionally, all controls are remappable to fit your preference. :)
